# Shopping-List
This is a shopping list application where you can create your own list.
Can do certain tasks relating to lists (such as adding, deleting, etc.)
First it asks for an input on what the user wants to do
Then it performs the task as told.
There are 5 tasks the user can choose from:
Add - Add an item to the list
View - prints the latest version of the list
Mark as complete - Checks off an item from the list
Remove - Deletes an item from the list
Quit - exits the program

Worked on this with another programmer (Alice)
